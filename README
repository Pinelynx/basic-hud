Basic HUD
=========

A simple Android application that demostrates a basic heads-up display.
The application is built using Android studio version 1.0.2
An .apk (Basic HUD.apk) is provided in the repository in case the project fails to compile (feel free to ask for help if that happens).
Installing the application via .apk requires enabling "Allow installation of non-Market application" in phone settings.
The application has no known bugs, but if you do find any, please leave a comment describing the bug.
